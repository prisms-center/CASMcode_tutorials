    "The effective Hamiltonians that CASM generates are constructed so that they obey the same symmetry as the prim structure. After initializing a project, it is a good idea to check that CASM has identified all of the expected symmetries. \n",
    "\n",
    "If CASM fails to find some expected symmetries it may mean that that there is a mistake, or that lattice vectors or basis site coordinates do not include enough significant digits. With too few, the equivalence of sites or lattice vectors under the action of symmetry operations may be missed. CASM uses a default tolerance of 1e-5 for crystallography routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the project is initialized, the symmetry CASM has found can be printed using the `sym` command. `sym` will print information about three important symmetry groups. Each group is a vector of representative symmetry operations. The symmetery operations transform a spatial coordinate $x \\rightarrow x'$ according to $x' = A*x+b$, where $A$ is the 3x3 \"operation matrix\" and $b$ is the \"shift\" vector. Operations may be printed either in fractional coordinates (FRAC) or Cartesian coordinates (CART).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lattice point group**: This is the point group of the Bravais lattice: the list of operations that map the lattice (i.e. all points that are integer multiples of the lattice vectors) onto itself and keep the origin fixed. The \"shift\" vectors will always be zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **factor group**: The crystal space group is the set of all symmetry operations that map the lattice onto itself and map basis sites onto equivalent basis sites (i.e. all degrees of freedom are equivalent). The crystal space group is not limited to operations that keep the origin fixed, so due to the perdiodicity of the crystal the crystal space group is infinite. The factor group is a finite description of the crystal space group, in which all operations that differ only by a \"shift\" are represented by a single operation whose \"shift\" lies within the primitive cell. Formally, this is a group formed by the cosets of $T$ in $S$, where $T$ is the translation group of the Bravais lattice and $S$ is the crystal space group.\n",
    "\n",
